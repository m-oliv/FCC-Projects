                        Joe MacMillan is a charismatic ex-IBM sales executive. After he quits IBM, he moves to Dallas and shows up at Cardiff Electric's
                        headquarters. He talks his way into a senior position at the company. Joe creates a team of engineers
                        with the sole purpose of reverse-engineering IBM's computer and creating a better version of the
                        product. Joe handles the marketing and sales of this project, sometimes almost going overboard while
                        doing so. To handle the hardware, Joe challenges Gordon Clark, a good engineer who's down on his
                        luck. The software is handled by Cameron Howe, a young programmer, with whom Joe develops a volatile
                        relationship.

                        Building Cardiff's computer tests Joe's relationships, getting him friends and a lot of enemies. When the project goes horribly
                        wrong, Joe almost gives up on it. However, Gordon, with the help of his wife, and Cameron manage
                        to save the day. Together, Joe and Co. present the prototype of their computer - nicknamed The Giant
                        - at Comdex. Even though the Giant is a sales success, Joe is not pleased to find out that their
                        project is surpassed by Apple's Macintosh. He ends up burning a shipment of computers and leaving
                        the company and his team behind. When Joe is seen again, he has a totally different life and is still
                        searching for new and exciting tech projects.
